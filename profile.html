       I have three dogs.<br>The first one is a siberian huskey named gaza. it is very playful and never bark or bites because it only howls. during the night it's eyes turn red.it's really obedient.

      <br> my second dog is a boston terrier it's really smart,but also funny. But there's also a downside to it being smart.even though it can avoid dangers, it has a mind of it's own... that means it can be quite naughty and disagreeable
